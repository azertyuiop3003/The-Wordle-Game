## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start playing by guessing the word of the day. The game provides feedback on your guesses, indicating which letters are correct and in the right position, which letters are correct but in the wrong position, and which letters are not in the word at all.

### Game Rules

1. You have six attempts to guess the word.
2. Each guess must be a valid five-letter word.
3. After each guess, the game will provide feedback:
   - Green for correct letters in the correct position.
   - Yellow for correct letters in the wrong position.
   - Gray for letters not in the word.

## API Documentation

The backend API provides endpoints for fetching random words and checking word validity. You can view the full API documentation using Swagger.

### Endpoints

- **GET /api/word**: Fetch a random word.
- **POST /api/check**: Check if a word is valid.

You can explore the API documentation in detail by accessing the Swagger UI provided in the project.
